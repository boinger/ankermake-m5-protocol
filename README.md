# AnkerMake M5 Protocol

Welcome! This repository contains `ankerctl`, a command-line interface and web UI for monitoring, controlling, and interfacing with AnkerMake M5 3D printers.

**Note:** While changes are tested carefully, bugs still happen. If you run into one, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Django1982/ankermake-m5-protocol/issues/new/choose).

This repository continues the work started by the original `Ankermgmt/ankermake-m5-protocol` team. Thanks to the original authors for the reverse engineering work and the foundation this fork builds on.

The `ankerctl` program uses [`libflagship`](documentation/developer-docs/libflagship.md), a library for communicating with the multiple protocols required to connect to an AnkerMake M5 printer. `libflagship` is maintained in this repo under [`libflagship/`](libflagship/).

## Current Features

- Print directly from slicers such as **PrusaSlicer, SuperSlicer, OrcaSlicer, Bambu Studio**, and other compatible slicers that can submit jobs to a custom print host.
- Connect to AnkerMake M5 printers and AnkerMake cloud APIs without relying on closed-source Anker software.
- Multi-printer support with per-printer status, controls, history, media views, and settings.
- Send raw G-code commands to the printer and view responses in real time.
- Low-level access to MQTT, PPPP, and HTTPS APIs for debugging and advanced integrations.
- Upload G-code to the printer, start prints from compatible printer storage entries, and reprint compatible archived jobs from history.
- View printer storage, USB storage, and print history with thumbnail previews when available.
- Automatic print history backed by SQLite, including filename, timestamps, duration, result, thumbnails, and reprint availability.
- Automatic timelapse capture during prints, including pause, resume, stop, partial-save-on-failure behavior, and MP4 assembly at print end. Requires `ffmpeg`.
- Dedicated **Snapshots** page for timelapse frames and manual snapshots, including preview, download, and delete actions.
- Stream the built-in printer camera to your computer, with support for optional external camera feeds and a camera setup page.
- Manual snapshot capture from the Home page, with snapshots saved into the Snapshots gallery.
- Live ankerctl console viewer on the Home page, with recent history and live updates.
- Filament status indicators and filament-change awareness in printer status.
- Safer filament management tools, including validation for blank profile names, clearer in-page error handling, and protection against unsafe legacy filament-apply actions during active prints.
- Sticky printer alerts and notifications, including support for events from printers other than the currently selected one.
- Push notifications via [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) for print start, finish, failure, upload, and progress, with optional image attachments.
- Home Assistant MQTT Discovery integration for printer state, temperatures, progress, and light control.
- Optional API key protection for write operations and sensitive API endpoints.
- Debug tab (enable with `ANKERCTL_DEV_MODE=true`) with a state inspector, service health panel, event simulation, and log viewer.
- Bed Level Map (Setup -> Tools) that reads the 7x7 bilinear compensation grid via `M420 V`, renders it as a heatmap, and supports before/after comparison snapshots.
- Improved account import and login flows:
  - CLI import supports legacy `login.json` / `user_info` files and the newer **eufyMake Studio Windows WebView LevelDB cache** (`.ldb` files).
  - Windows autodetect prefers the newest usable slicer session record instead of older stale cache blobs.
  - Import can recover certain truncated WebView auth-token cases by validating candidate prefixes against the API.
  - The web UI includes a one-click **Import From eufyMake Studio** flow plus manual upload fallback.
  - The Setup page shows clear success and failure banners for both import and direct login flows.
  - Manual login trims inputs, normalizes country codes, stays on-page on failure, and prevents duplicate submits while fetching.
- Includes a downloadable Windows launcher.

## Installation

Choose **one** installation method:

- [Install from Git](documentation/install-from-git.md) — recommended
- [Install from Docker](documentation/install-from-docker.md)

Suggested order of operations:

1. Choose an installation method.
2. Complete the install steps for that method.
3. Import your AnkerMake account configuration or sign in directly.
4. Start `ankerctl` from the CLI or launch the web server.

> **Note**
> Minimum supported Python version is **3.10**.

> **Warning**
> Docker installation currently works on **Linux only**.

## Importing Configuration

There are now **three** supported ways to get account and printer data into `ankerctl`:

1. **CLI import** from a cached AnkerMake/eufyMake session
2. **Web UI import** from an uploaded file or from an open eufyMake Studio session on the same machine
3. **Direct login** with your email and password

### Option 1: CLI import

Open a terminal in the `ankerctl` folder and run:

```sh
python3 ankerctl.py config import
```

When no filename is provided, `ankerctl` tries to auto-detect a supported cached login source.

#### What the CLI importer can read

- Legacy `login.json`
- Legacy `user_info`
- Newer **eufyMake Studio Windows WebView LevelDB cache files** (`.ldb`)

On modern Windows installs, the importer can scan the LevelDB session cache and select a usable eufyMake Studio session automatically.

> **Important**
> When importing from the newer eufyMake Studio cache on Windows, keep **eufyMake Studio open and signed in** while you run the import.

#### Example commands

**Auto-detect supported cache files**

```sh
python3 ankerctl.py config import
```

**Windows legacy cache example**

```sh
python3 ankerctl.py config import %APPDATA%\Roaming\eufyMake Studio Profile\cache\offline\user_info
```

**Windows newer eufyMake Studio LevelDB folder example**

```sh
python3 ankerctl.py config import %LOCALAPPDATA%\eufyMake Studio Profile\EBWebView\Default\Local Storage\leveldb\000123.ldb
```

**macOS example**

```sh
./ankerctl.py config import $HOME/Library/Application Support/eufyMake Studio Profile\EBWebView\Default\Local Storage\leveldb\000123.ldb
```

**Linux/Wine example**

```sh
./ankerctl.py config import ~/.wine/drive_c/users/username/AppData/Roaming/eufyMake Studio Profile/EBWebView/Default/Local Storage/leveldb/000123.ldb
```

Type `ankerctl.py config import -h` for all options.

To learn more about the underlying account and printer data used during import, see:

- [MQTT Overview](documentation/developer-docs/mqtt-overview.md)
- [Example Files](documentation/developer-docs/example-file-usage)

#### Example successful import output

```sh
[*] Loading cache..
[*] Initializing API..
[*] Requesting profile data..
[*] Requesting printer list..
[*] Requesting pppp keys..
[*] Adding printer [AK7ABC0123401234]
[*] Finished import
```

After import, your configuration is stored in `ankerctl`'s managed config file. You can inspect the saved account and printer info with:

```sh
./ankerctl.py config show
[*] Account:
    user_id: 01234567890abcdef012...<REDACTED>
    email:   bob@example.org
    region:  eu

[*] Printers:
    sn: AK7ABC0123401234
    duid: EUPRAKM-001234-ABCDE
```

### Option 2: Web UI import

The web UI supports two import paths in **Setup -> Account**:

#### A. One-click import from an open eufyMake Studio session

Use **Import From eufyMake Studio**.

This is the easiest option on supported systems because the server will:

- look for the correct slicer cache automatically
- choose the newest usable session record
- import the account and printer data for you
- show a clear success or failure banner after reload

> **Important**
> Keep **eufyMake Studio open and signed in** before using this button.

#### B. Manual upload fallback

If one-click import is unavailable or fails, you can still upload a supported file manually from **Setup -> Account**.

Supported upload sources include:

- `login.json`
- `user_info`
- `000123.ldb`
- supported eufyMake Studio cache files such as `.ldb`

The Setup page now refers to this more accurately as a **login file or slicer cache**, not only a login file.

#### What success and failure look like in the web UI

A successful import shows a green banner similar to:

```text
Configuration imported from open eufyMake Studio for your@email.com with 2 printers.
```

A failed import shows a red banner with the actual reason.

### Option 3: Direct login

You can also fetch account and printer data directly from the AnkerMake servers.

#### CLI direct login

```sh
./ankerctl.py config login DE
```

You will be prompted for your email and password. If AnkerMake requires a CAPTCHA, the CLI will open it in your browser and ask for the answer.

#### Web UI direct login

In **Setup -> Account**, use the manual login form.

Recent improvements to this flow include:

- trimmed email, country, and CAPTCHA fields
- automatic uppercase normalization for country codes
- better inline error handling without bouncing away from the page
- a disabled Fetch button with spinner while the request is running
- clearer success and failure banners

A successful direct login shows a green banner similar to:

```text
Configuration fetched from AnkerMake server for your@email.com with 2 printers.
```

A failed login stays on the same page and shows the actual error in red.

> **Note**
> The cached login info contains sensitive details. In particular, the `user_id` field is used when connecting to MQTT servers and effectively behaves like a password. For that reason the value is redacted when printed to the screen.

Once import or login succeeds, `ankerctl` is ready to use.

## Usage

### Web Interface

Start the web server from the folder where you installed `ankerctl`. The web server must be running whenever you want to:

- use the web interface
- send jobs from a slicer
- use browser-based controls, history, timelapse, snapshots, or camera pages

#### Docker installation

```sh
# Build the image (match UID/GID to your host user)
docker build -t django01982/ankerctl:local --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) .

# Copy .env.example to .env and adjust values, then start
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up
```

#### Git/Python installation

```sh
./ankerctl.py webserver run
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:4470
```

in a browser on the same machine.

> **Important**
> If account configuration has not been imported yet, go to **Setup -> Account** and either:
>
> - click **Import From eufyMake Studio**
> - upload a supported login file or slicer cache
> - or sign in directly with email and password

### Slicer Integration

ankerctl can receive jobs from slicers that support a custom print host / HTTP upload workflow.

Tested slicers include:

- PrusaSlicer
- SuperSlicer
- OrcaSlicer
- Bambu Studio

The web server must be running before the slicer can send a job.

#### Important behavior

At the moment, slicer-hosted upload is intended for immediate use, so the common workflow is:

- **Send and Print** to upload and start the print right away

Additional slicer-specific instructions are available in the web interface Instructions page.

![Screenshot of PrusaSlicer](/static/img/setup/prusaslicer-2.png "Screenshot of prusa slicer")

### Authentication (API Key)

ankerctl supports optional API key authentication.

When enabled:

- **write operations** and **sensitive API endpoints** require the key
- the normal read-only web UI remains viewable
- slicers must send the same key if they are uploading through the host interface

#### Enable via CLI

```sh
# Generate a random API key
./ankerctl.py config set-password

# Or set a specific key
./ankerctl.py config set-password my-secret-key

# Remove key (disable authentication)
./ankerctl.py config remove-password
```

#### Enable via Docker environment variable

```yaml
# In .env (see .env.example)
ANKERCTL_API_KEY=my-secret-key
```

#### Using the key

- **Slicer:** enter the key in the slicer's API Key field so it is sent as the `X-Api-Key` header
- **Browser:** append `?apikey=your-key` to the URL once; a session cookie is set automatically
- **No key set:** authentication stays disabled for backward compatibility

## Notifications (Apprise)

ankerctl supports push notifications via [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise), which supports many notification services including Discord, Telegram, Slack, Pushover, and email.

### Setup options

1. Configure notifications in the **Setup -> Notifications** page
2. Or configure them with environment variables

ankerctl requires an **Apprise API server** rather than only the CLI package. You can:

- run the [Apprise API Docker container](https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api)
- use a hosted Apprise API instance

### Example configuration

```sh
# Connection settings
APPRISE_ENABLED=true
APPRISE_SERVER_URL=http://apprise:8000  # Your Apprise API server URL
APPRISE_KEY=ankerctl                     # Apprise notification key/ID
APPRISE_TAG=critical                     # Optional: Apprise tag filter

# Event toggles (set to true/false)
APPRISE_EVENT_PRINT_STARTED=true         # Notify when print starts
APPRISE_EVENT_PRINT_FINISHED=true        # Notify when print completes
APPRISE_EVENT_PRINT_FAILED=true          # Notify when print fails
APPRISE_EVENT_GCODE_UPLOADED=true        # Notify when G-code uploaded
APPRISE_EVENT_PRINT_PROGRESS=true        # Notify on print progress updates

# Progress notification settings
APPRISE_PROGRESS_INTERVAL=25             # Progress interval (e.g., every 25%)
APPRISE_PROGRESS_INCLUDE_IMAGE=false     # Attach camera snapshot to progress notifications
APPRISE_SNAPSHOT_QUALITY=hd              # Snapshot quality: 'sd', 'hd', or 'fhd' (1920x1080)
APPRISE_SNAPSHOT_FALLBACK=true           # Use G-code preview if live snapshot fails
APPRISE_PROGRESS_MAX=0                   # Override progress scale (0=auto)
```

### Testing your setup

1. Open **Setup -> Notifications**
2. Enter your Apprise server URL and key
3. Enable the events you want
4. Click **Send test**
5. Confirm the notification arrives

### Image attachments

When image attachments are enabled for progress or finish notifications, ankerctl will:

1. try to capture a live camera snapshot
2. fall back to the G-code preview if live capture fails and fallback is enabled
3. send a text-only notification if neither image source works

> **Note**
> Live snapshots require a working PPPP connection and video stream.

## Print History

ankerctl automatically records every print to a local SQLite database and shows it in the **History** tab.

### What is tracked

- filename
- start time
- finish time
- duration
- result (`finished`, `failed`, `cancelled`)

### Configuration

- `PRINT_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS` — entries older than this are pruned automatically
- `PRINT_HISTORY_MAX_ENTRIES` — oldest entries are pruned when the maximum is reached

### API endpoints

- `GET /api/history` — list entries (supports `?limit=` and `?offset=`)
- `DELETE /api/history` — clear all history (requires API key if configured)

No setup is required. History is recorded automatically.

## Timelapse

ankerctl can capture a timelapse video automatically for every print.

### Requirements

`ffmpeg` must be installed and available in `PATH`.

### Features

- captures a snapshot every `TIMELAPSE_INTERVAL_SEC` seconds
- assembles frames into an MP4 at print end
- saves a partial video if the print fails
- supports a **resume window** so a resumed print can continue appending to the same timelapse
- prunes old videos when `TIMELAPSE_MAX_VIDEOS` is reached

### Timelapse light behavior

Configure `TIMELAPSE_LIGHT` globally or through the Setup page.

- `snapshot` — turn the light on for each frame, then back off
- `session` — keep the light on for the whole capture session
- unset — do not change the light automatically

Videos can be listed, downloaded, and deleted from the **Timelapse** tab.

### API endpoints

- `GET /api/timelapses` — list available videos with metadata
- `GET /api/timelapse/<filename>` — download a video
- `DELETE /api/timelapse/<filename>` — delete a video
- `GET /api/settings/timelapse`
- `POST /api/settings/timelapse`

## Camera Support

ankerctl supports:

- the built-in printer camera
- manual snapshot capture
- timelapse frame capture
- optional external camera feeds configured through the web UI

Use the camera-related setup pages to choose and configure the feed source that best matches your environment.

## Home Assistant Integration

ankerctl supports [Home Assistant MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/), publishing printer state directly to your Home Assistant instance.

### Requires

A running MQTT broker such as Mosquitto that both ankerctl and Home Assistant can reach.

### Published entities

- print progress, state, filename, speed, and current layer
- nozzle and bed temperatures
- elapsed and remaining time
- MQTT connected and PPPP connected binary sensors
- printer light switch, including bidirectional control
- camera stream entity

### Setup

1. Configure the `HA_MQTT_*` variables shown above, or
2. Use **Setup -> Home Assistant** in the web UI

### API endpoints

- `GET /api/settings/mqtt`
- `POST /api/settings/mqtt`

## Debug Tab (Development Mode)

Enable the Debug tab by setting:

```sh
ANKERCTL_DEV_MODE=true
```

A **Debug** tab then appears in the web UI.

> **Warning**
> Do not enable this in production. The Debug tab exposes internal state and allows simulated events.

### Included tools

- **State Inspector** — live JSON dump of current print state
- **Controls** — toggle verbose MQTT payload logging
- **Simulation** — fire synthetic events without a real printer
- **Services** — live service health panel with restart actions
- **Log Viewer** — browse log files from `ANKERCTL_LOG_DIR` with filtering

When an API key is configured, all `/api/debug/*` endpoints require authentication.

## Bed Level Map

The **Setup -> Tools** area includes a **Bed Level Map** tool that reads the bilinear compensation grid directly from the printer.

### How to use it

1. Run a `G29` auto-level cycle
2. Open **Setup -> Tools**
3. Click **Read from printer**
4. Review the heatmap and compare saved before/after snapshots

### Live progress

While `G29` is running, the UI can show how many of the 49 probe points have completed.

### API endpoint

- `GET /api/printer/bed-leveling` — returns `{grid, min, max, rows, cols}`

Do not call this during an active print.

## Command-Line Examples

```sh
# Run the web server
./ankerctl.py webserver run

# Set an API key for web authentication
./ankerctl.py config set-password

# Attempt to detect printers on the local network
./ankerctl.py pppp lan-search
