# AnkerMake M5 Protocol

Welcome! This repository contains `ankerctl`, a command-line interface and web UI for monitoring, controlling and interfacing with AnkerMake M5 3D printers.

**NOTE:** While we test changes carefully, bugs still happen. If you encounter one please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Django1982/ankermake-m5-protocol/issues/new/choose).

This repository continues the work started by the original `Ankermgmt/ankermake-m5-protocol` team. Thanks to the original authors for the reverse engineering work and the foundation this fork builds on.

The `ankerctl` program uses [`libflagship`](documentation/developer-docs/libflagship.md), a library for communicating with the numerous different protocols required for connecting to an AnkerMake M5 printer. The `libflagship` library is also maintained in this repo, under [`libflagship/`](libflagship/).

## Features

### Current Features

 - Print directly from PrusaSlicer and its derivatives (SuperSlicer, Bamboo Studio, OrcaSlicer, etc.)

 - Connect to AnkerMake M5 and AnkerMake APIs without using closed-source Anker software.

 - Send raw gcode commands to the printer (and see the response).

 - Low-level access to MQTT, PPPP and HTTPS APIs.

 - Send print jobs (gcode files) to the printer, print from printers internal or USB drive.

 - Stream camera image/video to your computer.

 - Easily monitor print status.

 - Automatic **print history** (SQLite-backed log of every print with start time, duration, result, reprint).

 - Automatic **timelapse** capture during prints — assembled into MP4 video at the end, now pauses on filament break/change (requires `ffmpeg`).

 - Live view of Ankerctl consel on home page.

 - Filament indicator in printer stats.

 - **Push notifications** via [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) for print start, finish, failure, and progress — with optional live camera snapshots attached.

 - **Home Assistant MQTT Discovery** integration — expose printer state, temperatures, progress, and light control directly to Home Assistant.

 - Optional **API key authentication** for all write operations.

 - **Debug tab** (enable with `ANKERCTL_DEV_MODE=true`) with state inspector, service health panel, event simulation, and log viewer.

 - **Bed Level Map** (Setup tab → Tools) — reads the 7×7 bilinear compensation grid from the printer via `M420 V`, renders it as a colour-coded heatmap, and supports before/after snapshot comparison to evaluate leveling results.

Let us know what you want to see; Pull requests always welcome!

## Installation

There are currently two ways to do an install of ankerctl. You can install directly from git utilizing python on your Operating System or you can install from Docker which will install ankerctl in a containerized environment. Only one installation method should be chosen. 

Order of Operations for Success:
- Choose installation method: [Docker](documentation/install-from-docker.md) or [Git](documentation/install-from-git.md)
- Follow the installation intructions for the install method
- Import the login.json file
- Have fun! Either run `ankerctl` from CLI or launch the webserver

> **Note**
> Minimum version of Python required is 3.10

> **Warning**
> Docker Installation ONLY works on Linux at this time

Follow the instructions for a [git install](documentation/install-from-git.md) (recommended), or [docker install](documentation/install-from-docker.md).

## Importing configuration

1. Import your AnkerMake account data by opening a terminal window in the folder you placed ankerctl in and running the following command:

   ```sh
   python3 ankerctl.py config import
   ```

   When run without filename on Windows and MacOS, the default location of `login.json` (or `user_info` on Windows) will be tried if no filename is specified.

   Otherwise, you can specify the file path for `login.json`. Example for Linux:
   ```sh
   ./ankerctl.py config import ~/.wine/drive_c/users/username/AppData/Roaming/eufyMake Studio Profile/cache/offline/user_info
   ```
   MacOS
   ```sh
   ./ankerctl.py config import $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/AnkerMake/AnkerMake_64bit_fp/login.json
   ```
   Windows
   ```sh
   python3 ankerctl.py config import %APPDATA%\Roaming\eufyMake Studio Profile\cache\offline\user_info
   ```

   Type `ankerctl.py config import -h` for more details on the import options. To learn more about the method used to extract the login information and add printers, see the [MQTT Overview](documentation/developer-docs/mqtt-overview.md) and [Example Files](documentation/developer-docs/example-file-usage) documentation.

   Alternatively, you can log in directly with email/password:

   ```sh
   ./ankerctl.py config login DE
   ```

   You will be prompted for email and password. If AnkerMake requires a CAPTCHA (usually after multiple failed attempts),
   the CLI will open it in your browser and ask for the answer.

   The output when successfully importing a config is similar to this:

   ```sh
   [*] Loading cache..
   [*] Initializing API..
   [*] Requesting profile data..
   [*] Requesting printer list..
   [*] Requesting pppp keys..
   [*] Adding printer [AK7ABC0123401234]
   [*] Finished import
   ```

   At this point, your config is saved to a configuration file managed by `ankerctl`. To see an overview of the stored data, use `config show`:

   ```sh
   ./ankerctl.py config show
   [*] Account:
       user_id: 01234567890abcdef012...<REDACTED>
       email:   bob@example.org
       region:  eu
   
   [*] Printers:
       sn: AK7ABC0123401234
       duid: EUPRAKM-001234-ABCDE
   ```

> **NOTE:** 
> The cached login info contains sensitive details. In particular, the `user_id` field is used when connecting to MQTT servers, and essentially works as a password. Thus, the end of the value is redacted when printed to screen, to avoid accidentally disclosing sensitive information.

2. Now that the printer information is known to `ankerctl`, the tool is ready to use. There’s a lot of available commands and utilities, use a command followed by `-h` to learn what your options are and get more in specific usage instructions.

> **NOTE:**
> As an alternative to using "config import" on the command line, it is possible to upload `login.json` through the web interface.
> You can also use email/password login in the web UI (Setup tab). Either method will work fine.

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Start the webserver by running one of the following commands in the folder you placed ankerctl in. You’ll need to have this running whenever you want to use the web interface or send jobs to the printer via a slicer:

   Docker Installation Method:

   ```sh
   # Build the image (match UID/GID to your host user)
   docker build -t django01982/ankerctl:local --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) .

   # Copy .env.example to .env and adjust values, then start
   cp .env.example .env
   docker compose up
   ```

   Git Installation Method Using Python:

   ```sh
   ./ankerctl.py webserver run
   ```

2. Navigate to [http://localhost:4470](http://localhost:4470) in your browser of choice on the same computer the webserver is running on. 
 
 > **Important**
 > If your `login.json` file was not automatically found, you’ll be prompted to upload your `login.json` file and the given the default path it should be found in your corresponding Operating System. 
   Once the `login.json` has been uploaded, the page will refresh and the web interface is usable.

### Authentication (API Key)

ankerctl supports optional API key authentication. When enabled, all web and API endpoints require a valid key.

**Enable via CLI:**

```sh
# Generate a random API key
./ankerctl.py config set-password

# Or set a specific key
./ankerctl.py config set-password my-secret-key

# Remove key (disable authentication)
./ankerctl.py config remove-password
```

**Enable via Docker (environment variable):**

```yaml
# In .env (see .env.example)
ANKERCTL_API_KEY=my-secret-key
```

**Using the key:**

- **Slicer (PrusaSlicer, OrcaSlicer, etc.):** Enter the key as the API Key in the printer settings (sent as `X-Api-Key` header)
- **Browser:** Append `?apikey=your-key` to the URL once — a session cookie is set automatically
- **No key set** = no authentication (backwards compatible, default behavior)
- The **WebUI is always readable** (status, video, etc.) — the key is only required for write operations (uploading files, sending gcode, controlling the printer)

### Environment Variables

ankerctl is configured via environment variables. For Docker deployments, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the values — Docker Compose loads them automatically.

### Notifications (Apprise)

ankerctl supports push notifications via [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise), a universal notification library that supports 90+ notification services (Discord, Telegram, Slack, Pushover, email, and many more).

**Setup Options:**
1. **Web UI** (recommended): Configure in the Setup tab under Notifications
2. **Environment Variables**: Useful for Docker deployments (see below)

ankerctl requires an external Apprise API server (not the CLI tool). You can:
- Run the [Apprise API Docker container](https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api)
- Use a hosted Apprise API instance

**Configuration via Environment Variables:**

```sh
# Connection settings
APPRISE_ENABLED=true
APPRISE_SERVER_URL=http://apprise:8000  # Your Apprise API server URL
APPRISE_KEY=ankerctl                     # Apprise notification key/ID
APPRISE_TAG=critical                     # Optional: Apprise tag filter

# Event toggles (set to true/false)
APPRISE_EVENT_PRINT_STARTED=true         # Notify when print starts
APPRISE_EVENT_PRINT_FINISHED=true        # Notify when print completes
APPRISE_EVENT_PRINT_FAILED=true          # Notify when print fails
APPRISE_EVENT_GCODE_UPLOADED=true        # Notify when G-code uploaded
APPRISE_EVENT_PRINT_PROGRESS=true        # Notify on print progress updates

# Progress notification settings
APPRISE_PROGRESS_INTERVAL=25             # Progress interval (e.g., every 25%)
APPRISE_PROGRESS_INCLUDE_IMAGE=false     # Attach camera snapshot to progress notifications
APPRISE_SNAPSHOT_QUALITY=hd              # Snapshot quality: 'sd', 'hd', or 'fhd' (1920x1080)
APPRISE_SNAPSHOT_FALLBACK=true           # Use G-code preview if live snapshot fails
APPRISE_PROGRESS_MAX=0                   # Override progress scale (0=auto)
```

**Testing Your Setup:**

1. Open Setup → Notifications in the web UI
2. Enter your Apprise server URL and key
3. Enable notifications and select desired events
4. Click **Send test** and verify the notification arrives
5. Test with real events:
   - Upload a G-code file → verify upload notification
   - Start a print → verify start/progress/finish notifications

**Image Attachments:**

When "Include image" is enabled for progress/finish notifications, ankerctl will:
1. Attempt to capture a live camera snapshot (requires `ffmpeg` installed)
2. If live capture fails and "Fallback to preview image" is enabled, attach the G-code preview image instead
3. If both fail, send text-only notification

**Note:** Live snapshots require an active PPPP connection and working video stream.

### Print History

ankerctl automatically records every print to a local SQLite database and shows it in the History tab.

**What is tracked:**
- Filename, start time, finish time, duration, result (finished/failed/cancelled)

**Configuration:**
- `PRINT_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS` (default: 90) — entries older than this are pruned automatically
- `PRINT_HISTORY_MAX_ENTRIES` (default: 500) — oldest entries are pruned when the limit is reached

**API endpoints:**
- `GET /api/history` — list entries (supports `?limit=` and `?offset=` query params)
- `DELETE /api/history` — clear all history (requires API key if configured)

No setup required — history is recorded automatically for every print.

### Timelapse

ankerctl can capture a timelapse video for every print automatically.

**Requirements:** `ffmpeg` must be available in `PATH`.

**Features:**
- Captures a snapshot from the camera every `TIMELAPSE_INTERVAL_SEC` seconds
- Assembles frames into an MP4 video at print end (dynamic FPS to produce ~30 second videos)
- Partial video is saved if the print fails
- **Resume window**: if a print resumes within 60 minutes (e.g. after a filament change), frames are seamlessly appended rather than starting a new video
- Oldest videos are pruned automatically when `TIMELAPSE_MAX_VIDEOS` is reached

**Light control during timelapse** (`TIMELAPSE_LIGHT` / Setup tab):
- `snapshot` — light turns on before each frame, then off again (1.5s on, 1s off delay)
- `session` — light stays on for the entire capture session
- *(unset)* — light is not touched

Videos can be listed, downloaded, and deleted from the Timelapse tab in the web UI.

**API endpoints:**
- `GET /api/timelapses` — list available videos with metadata
- `GET /api/timelapse/<filename>` — download a video
- `DELETE /api/timelapse/<filename>` — delete a video
- `GET /api/settings/timelapse` / `POST /api/settings/timelapse` — read/write configuration

### Home Assistant Integration

ankerctl supports [Home Assistant MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/), publishing printer state directly to your HA instance.

**Requires:** A running MQTT broker (e.g. Mosquitto) accessible to both ankerctl and Home Assistant.

**Published entities:**
- Print progress, status, filename, speed, current layer
- Nozzle and bed temperature (current and target)
- Time elapsed and time remaining
- MQTT connected, PPPP connected (binary sensors)
- Printer light (switch — bidirectional: HA can turn the light on/off)
- Camera (MJPEG stream)

**Setup:**
1. Configure `HA_MQTT_*` environment variables (see table above), or
2. Use the Setup → Home Assistant tab in the web UI

**API endpoints:**
- `GET /api/settings/mqtt` / `POST /api/settings/mqtt` — read/write HA MQTT configuration

### Debug Tab (Development Mode)

Enable the debug tab by setting `ANKERCTL_DEV_MODE=true`. A "Debug" tab appears in the web UI (indicated by a bug icon).

> **Warning:** Do not enable in production — the debug tab exposes internal state and allows firing simulated events.

**Sections:**
- **State Inspector** — live JSON dump of the current print state (progress, temperatures, filenames, timelapse)
- **Controls** — toggle verbose MQTT payload logging
- **Simulation** — fire synthetic events (print start, finish, fail, progress, temperature, speed, layer) without a real printer
- **Services** — live service health panel showing status and ref counts; supports restarting individual services; auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
- **Log Viewer** — file picker over log files from `ANKERCTL_LOG_DIR`, with level and text filtering; auto-refreshes every 5 seconds

All `/api/debug/*` endpoints require authentication when an API key is configured.

### Bed Level Map

The Setup tab contains a **Bed Level Map** tool that reads the bilinear compensation grid directly from the printer.

**How to use:**
1. Run a G29 auto-leveling cycle (via Setup → Level Bed, or manually send G29)
2. Open Setup → Tools and click **Read from printer** — ankerctl sends `M420 V` and parses the response
3. The grid is displayed as a colour-coded heatmap (blue = below average, red = above average)
4. Save a snapshot before and after adjustments to compare leveling results side-by-side

**Live progress:** While G29 is running, a progress bar shows how many of the 49 probe points have been completed.

**API endpoint:** `GET /api/printer/bed-leveling` — returns `{grid, min, max, rows, cols}` (takes up to ~15 seconds; do not call during an active print).

### Printing Directly from PrusaSlicer

ankerctl can allow slicers like PrusaSlicer (and its derivatives) to send print jobs to the printer using the slicer’s built in communications tools. The web server must be running in order to send jobs to the printer. 

Currently there’s no way to store the jobs for later printing on the printer, so you’re limited to using the “Send and Print” option only to immediately start the print once it’s been transmitted. 

Additional instructions can be found in the web interface.
